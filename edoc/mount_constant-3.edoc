@doc Convert flag names to integers

Names are derived from the C macro name with the underscore prefix
removed.  For example, `rdonly' is mapped to MS_RDONLY on Linux and
MNT_RDONLY on FreeBSD.

== Examples ==

```
1> {ok, Drv} = alcove_drv:start().
{ok,<0.177.0>}
2> alcove:mount_constant(Drv, [], rdonly).
1
3> alcove:mount_constant(Drv, [], 'RDONLY').
1
